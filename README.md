# Personality-Prediction-Model
This is the web based Personality prediction Machine Learning Modal ehich is based on he Big 5 Personality Traits.
## What is the The Big 5 Personality Traits?
The Big Five personality traits is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits, developed from the 1980s onward in psychological trait theory. Starting in the 1990s, the theory identified five factors by labels, for the US English speaking population, typically referred to as:

  -->openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)

  -->conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)

  -->extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)

  -->agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)

  -->neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

# Project Overview:

- Objective: Develop a predictive model to assign individuals to specific personality clusters based on their responses to an online personality test.
- Data Collection: Collected data through an interactive online personality test.
- Data Preprocessing: Ensured data quality, handled missing values, and prepared the data for analysis.
- Model Selection: Chose the k-means clustering algorithm for personality prediction.
- Result Interpretation: Implemented an interactive web-based approach to provide personalized results to users.
- Implications: Findings have applications in personalized marketing, recommendation systems, mental health interventions, and social network analysis.
- GitHub Hosting: Plan to host the project code and resources on GitHub for collaboration and further development.
- Conclusion: The project bridges personality psychology and machine learning, providing insights into personality traits and potential areas of development.
